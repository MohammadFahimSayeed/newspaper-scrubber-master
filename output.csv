Experts are concerned that the crisis might deepen if there is a further delay in reopening schools.

Speakers came up with the observations in a digital dialogue organised by Brac yesterday, marking International Day of the Girl Child.

Education minister Dr Dipu Moni joined the dialogue, titled ""Girls must return to schools,"" as chief guest.

She said, ""We have reached most of our target students in case of digital classrooms. The standard of classes being taken through televisions has improved. Not only the government, but many non-government institutions are taking online classes. So, it is not mandatory that students will have to go to classes. In many countries, schools have been shut after reopening. We need to consider every aspect before deciding on reopening our educational institutions.""

On girl children, the minister said, ""The birth registration process is being digitised at union levels. As a result, parents cannot fake their girls' age and marry them off early. Important topics such as women's repression, sexual violence is being included in our curriculum. Not only the Covid-19 crisis, we are repurposing our curriculum to tackle all sorts of challenges.""

Brac executive director Asif Saleh said, ""The long closure of schools are forcing our students to forget what they have already learnt. A research in Pakistan shows a five-month closure of schools have forced students backward for 14 months. We need to consider this in terms of our country. Rather than taking a sudden decision, we need constant monitoring to reopen our schools.""

Lawmaker Aroma Dutta said, ""Reality must be considered before taking any decision. It is true that we lost a lot during this pandemic. The rate of school dropouts has increased. We need to ensure technological and technical education for students, especially for girls, so that they can ensure their livelihood whenever needed.""

Campaign for Popular Education executive director Rasheda K Choudhury said, ""School closure has affected both our students and teachers. This pandemic is acting like a magnifying glass for us. Through this, we can examine all our mistakes and think of our way forward. Before reopening schools, we need to concentrate on the related data and reality.""

Prof Sadeka Halim said, ""Bangladesh has made remarkable progress in women's empowerment and girl children's empowerment... But child marriage has been instrumental to the drop-out rate of girls.""

""During this covid-19 crisis, we have seen that our education system is closely connected to our livelihood. So, we can't consider the education system as an isolated phenomenon. We need to think about what can be done for about 43 percent families who have been forced under the poverty line and these families have a large number of students from schools, colleges and universities,"" she added.

Bangladesh Police Women Network's president, additional commissioner Amena Begum said, ""Sometimes parents forcefully marry their girls early. To prevent early marriage people can avail services from police dialing 999. We are working on school programmes to make students aware of this.""

Prof Dr Sadeka Halim, Dean of Faculty of Social Sciences, University of Dhaka, and Australian High Commission in Dhaka's first secretary Simon Barclay also joined the event, moderated by Brac director Nobonita Chowdhury."

At least 149 people, including 22 women and 44 children, were killed, while 26 were injured and 58 remained missing in a total of 95 waterway accidents in the last three months.

The 58 missing victims were considered deceased, as they were not found, later raising the death toll to 207, revealed a survey of Green Club of Bangladesh (GCB) and National Committee to Protect Shipping, Roads and Railways.

The fatal accidents took place in different inland waterways and coastal areas between July 1 and September 30 across the country.

The survey was conducted by taking information from 24 national and 10 regional dailies, and nine news portals and agencies, says a press release.

The report said 86 people, including 10 women and 31 children, lost lives, while six were injured and 23 remained missing in 48 accidents in August.

As many as 10 accidents took place in September, where 22 people, including six women and eight children, lost lives, while 10 received injuries and 18 were missing.

Ashis Kumar Dey, general secretary of GCB, said deaths continue due to accidents of trawlers and other small vessels. He blamed lack of proper monitoring, a huge number of illegal vessels, unskilled operators and drivers for the accidents.

To qualify for the stipend, selected students must have 85 percent monthly attendance. They also need to take all school examinations and attain a minimum of 33 percent marks in each subject.

Each student fulfilling these criteria gets Tk 150 per month, as a single beneficiary of a family. Similarly, two children from the same family receive Tk 300 per month, whereas in case of three and four children, the stipend is Tk 400 and Tk 500 per month, respectively.

While sharing statistics, Taqbir Huda, research specialist at Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust (BLAST), presented a comparative analysis between the HC guidelines on such emergency medical services and provisions endorsed by the Road Transport Act, 2018.

""Provision no-13 of the guideline ensures protection of people who volunteer to help the road accident victims from police harassment and from obligation to give testimony before the court. Again, provision 14 states that it is the duty of police officers to ensure treatment for road accident victims. If ambulance is not available, police will use their own vehicles to take the victims to the nearest hospital. However, these provisions are not covered by the Road Transport Act, 2018,"" said Taqbir.

The Daily Star, Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust and ALAP jointly organised the webinar titled ""Emergency Medical Services for Road Accident Victims"" on October 9.

Barrister Sara Hossain, a Supreme Court lawyer; Dr Ashraf Uddin Ahmed, resident physician and assistant professor, in charge of medical emergency, BIRDEM; and Ilias Kanchan, Nirapad Sarak Chai chairman, spoke at the webinar.

It was moderated by Advocate Rashna Imam, founder, Academy of Law and Policy.

At the beginning of the session, the speakers presented statistics of road accidents.

According to Nirapad Sarak Chai, in 2019, 4,356 people were killed and 6,953 injured by road accidents. That means, on an average 11 were killed and 19 injured every day in the country last year.

Dr Ashraf Uddin Ahmed said, ""All the doctors must have life support and basic trauma management training so that they can provide emergency care to any road accident victim. BRTA while issuing driving licence can also ensure that all the drivers have first aid training before having a driving licence. Besides, trauma centres should be established all along the highways.""

""Our ambulance services should also be improved significantly. Ambulances should be equipped with life support equipment and manned by at least one paramedic,"" he said.

Focusing on the legal aspects, Barrister Sara said, ""Lawyers mobilise more to get a full-fledged law ensuring medical services for road accident victims. Meanwhile, we should circulate the High Court guidelines that guarantee emergency medical treatment for them.""

""We are also legally bound to abide by the guidelines. These guidelines should be translated into Bengali and circulated widely through mainstream and social media,"" she added.

Ilias Kanchan, who has been protesting for safer road for more than 27 years, emphasised investment, political will and coordination between ministries.

He said, ""Road transport sector should not be operated only under the communication ministry. This sector has a lot to do with public health. There should be a coordinating body between health and communication ministries to monitor medical services for accident victims.""

""We also need a lot of investment to build safer roads, to provide medical care and to improve public transport condition. For such a large scale investment, motivation to reform the sector from the political leadership is essential,"" said Ilias Kanchan."

Led by Rahmuna Ahmed, a writer, researcher and anthropologist, the delegation issued the statement yesterday.

Other members of the delegation were Bithi Ghosh, a teacher and cultural activist; Jannatul Mawa, political activist and photographer; Mahfuza Haq, cultural and human rights activist; Shipra Bosh, development activist; and Taslima Akhter, organiser of workers and women's movement.

They visited Noakhali's Begumganj from Dhaka and exchanged views with a cross-section of society, including the Deputy Commissioner and Police Superintendent of Noakhali.

They also spoke to the rape victim.

The statement said the victim will not get justice if the ongoing movement is limited only to demanding arrest and punishment of the perpetrators. Questions must be raised and movement waged against the source of power of the perpetrators, who are patronised by the ruling force.

""It was not possible to ensure a safe life and safe movement for women keeping the source of power of Delwar gang hidden,"" the delegation said in the statement.

During their meeting with the Deputy Commissioner and SP of Noakhali and officer-in-charge of Begumganj Police Station, they called upon the authority figures to play the highest role in ensuring safety of the rape victim.

They also called upon all to wage a strong social movement against all incidents of rape and repression against women including the one in Noakhali.

While talking with the rape victim, they assured that she is not alone in the movement against rape. They also said her courage will strengthen the movement against rape and rape culture.

According to the case statement filed by the victim on October 4, the perpetrators including the main accused Badal, ""Delwar Bahini"" chief Delwar, Rahmat Ullah and Abdur Rahim, among others entered the house of the victim and beat up her husband on the night of the incident.

They took him to the adjacent room and tied him up.

Later, they tortured the victim and assaulted her while filming the incident on their phone.

At one point, locals gathered around the house hearing the victim's cry for help. The accused then threatened to kill her if she spoke about the incident, and left.

The victim, fearing for her life, fled her house and has been living elsewhere since then.

The perpetrators, however, contacted her over phone and threatened to release the recorded video of the incident on social media if she did not go back to her house and agree to their demands. As the victim did not agree to their immoral proposals, they released the video on social media on October 4.

As the video circulated widely, police located her and questioned her about the incident, following which she filed the case against her perpetrators, the statement reads.

The whole country was sparked with outrage after the recorded video of the incident was released on social media."

The outrage currently gripping the country over rape and gender-based violence is an indictment that the problem is very real. However, life does not stop, and in spite of their utter discomfort, many women have to travel alone, while some need to stay the night, away from the safety of their families.

In such cases, accommodation in expensive hotels is hard to afford for many, and cheap hotels may not also suffice due to inadequate security measures.

Taking these issues into consideration, Bidyanondo Foundation has established ""Bashonti Nibash"" in March. Inaugurated on Women's Day, this women-only hostel is located in Pallabi, Mirpur, with continuous CCTV surveillance, and other security measures. A night's stay costs Tk 199.

The hostel provides affordable accommodation to women, and includes contemporary requirements like Wi-Fi, air-conditioning, laundry services and a computer zone. It does not allow a prolonged stay, although under special circumstances, it allows guests to stay a maximum of seven days.

For students staying for one night, the same package is offered only at Tk 1 for the first night, and Tk 199 per night from the second night onwards.

""Our volunteers have to travel a lot for work,"" says Rakhima Khatun, a volunteer of the foundation who manages Bashonti Nibash. ""During one such trip, a volunteer and her husband checked into a cheap hotel for the night, where they fell victim to harassment by a few local miscreants.""

""The issue was later brought up by the volunteer in a conversation with our founder, who pledged to establish an affordable and safe hostel for women. That's how our journey began,"" she said.

Rakhima said, ""The premises are under CCTV surveillance, and no men are allowed to enter the hostel. Volunteers are present to help the guests settle in. Besides, we have notified the local police station of how we operate, and if needed, we can always seek help from them.""

Currently, the hostel can accommodate up to 36 guests. Each guest is provided with their own bunk bed in the form of medium-sized capsules. They also have private shower and bathroom facilities, with a small dining area as well.

""I came to know about the hostel from a friend,"" said Jyotika Khisa Joyi, a college student visiting from Khagrachhari. ""The best part about this place is that girls can stay here alone without fear, and that too for such a low cost,"" adds Joyi.

Farjana Zabin Dola, visiting the capital from Kushtia for medical purposes, said, ""The current situation regarding women's safety in our country is distressing. But with the security facilities at this hostel, parents can feel assured to let their daughters stay here."""

Sudipto, a master's student of Government City College and an assistant general secretary of the city unit of BCL, was beaten to death in front of his house in port city's Sadarghat area on October 6, 2017.

According to police and family, a group of people arrived in the area by eight to nine auto-rickshaws and motorbikes and murdered Sudipto.

Sudipto's father Meghnath Biswas filed a case with Sadarghat Police Station accusing seven to eight unknown persons that day. Later, the case was transferred to Police Bureau of Investigation, who are yet to submit a charge sheet.

PBI sources said police arrested 18 people, mostly BCL activists, in the case. Of them, 16 are now on bail.

Sudipto's peers and followers alleged that Didarul Alam Masum, a former BCL leader of the college and general secretary of Lalkhan Bazar ward unit of Awami League, plotted the killing.

Masum, however, denied the allegation, claiming that it's a ""conspiracy"" against him by his rivals.

Sudipto's father, who retired from a primary school as a headteacher seven years ago, recently told The Daily Star that all he wants is justice. ""PBI has been assuring us of submitting a charge sheet for a long time, but to no avail,"" he added. According to a number of BCL leaders and investigators, Sudipto was vocal against ""misconducts"" in student organisations and wanted an end to it.

On Facebook, he often criticised senior leaders known as ""big brothers"" and such outspokenness may have led to his murder, they said. Two days before his murder, he wrote that a leader is nothing without his/her activists and activists should revolt to achieve something.

Nurul Azim Roni, former general secretary of Chattogram city unit of BCL, alleged that law enforcers are ""wasting time"". They have enough evidence -- including CCTV footage -- to submit the charge sheet, he claimed.

""If we don't find out the root of the problems, irregularities will not be dispelled…,"" he said without elaborating the irregularities.

He made the comment while speaking as chief guest at a meeting organised in memory of late Attorney General Mahbubey Alam who passed away on September 27.

Law Reporters Forum (LRF) organised the event at the Supreme Court Bar Association auditorium.

Mahmud Hossain said, ""Mahbubey Alam had told me that all the irregularities at the court must be stopped and he also said if a central system (of filing cases) is introduced, the irregularities will be prevented.""

""I want his wish to be implemented. No case will be heard and disposed of from now on breaking the serial,"" the chief justice said.

He also asked journalists to publish reports on SC verdicts regarding confirmation of death sentences of convicts along with verdicts of the acquittals of accused.

He said the government is embarrassed at the incidents of rape as a minister reportedly said the government cannot avoid the responsibility of the incidents. ""We, who are in the judiciary, also want proper trial of the incidents,"" he said.

Reminiscing works and life of Mahbubey Alam, the chief justice prayed for eternal peace and salvation of his departed soul.

Law Minister Anisul Huq, who spoke as special guest, told the meeting that the late attorney general never compromised with his non-communal belief and spirit of the Liberation War.

He never backtracked from protecting the independence and dignity of the judiciary. ""If the rare qualities of Mahbubey Alam are followed, he will be honoured properly,"" the minister said.

Fisheries and Livestock Minister SM Rezaul Karim said giving false enrolment certificates by the Bangladesh Bar Council has been stopped through the sole attempts of Mahbubey Alam as its chairman.

The judiciary has accepted and recorded many of his (Mahbubey Alam) arguments, he said, adding that research on Mahbubey Alam needs to take place.

Diamond Al-Amin was also produced before the court with a seven-day remand prayer, but the court decided his hearing will be held at the juvenile court on Sunday, after a defence lawyer claimed that his client's age is below 18.

THE CASE STATEMENT

According to the case statement, on August 30 around 3pm, the victim, a factory worker, along with a female friend, and a distant uncle of her and her uncle's neighbour, went for a visit in North Pabnartek area. There, around 15 gang members including named accused cornered them. They beat up the four and forcibly took the two girls to two separate remote places nearby, and gang-raped one. They also recorded the incident on video. They freed the two around 5:30pm, after giving them death threats.

Police were also interrogating the two young men who were with the victims at the time.

'NOT REPORTED EARLIER OUT OF FEAR'

On Wednesday, talking to reporters in presence of police, the uncle of the victim (20), also a worker of a local cap factory, said after the incident, the girls said they were assaulted and not raped. ""We did not report it because of the threats issued by the gang members,"" he said.

""As a video of the incident was leaked somehow three days ago, we came to know that my niece was gang-raped,"" he said, adding that his niece left her job and went back to her village.

According to police and locals, after the video came to light, Akram, a local businessman and father of Sharuf, tried to mitigate the issue by providing money to the victim's family.

Akram admitted to a journalist over phone that he collected money from parents of the other gang members to pay the victim family and settle the matter outside court. The Daily Star has a copy of the conversation.

The proposal was made on Monday during a rare two-day joint visit to Myanmar by Indian Army chief Manoj Mukund Naravane and Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla. They called on Myanmar State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and the chief of Myanmar Army Senior General Min Aung Hlaing.

""This project would be a win-win arrangement for both countries... As of now, Indian Oil Corp has evinced interest in the project,"" reported Livemint, quoting a source as saying.

India's move to ensure that Myanmar does not get firmly set in China's orbit comes at a time when there are renewed efforts by Beijing to woo Myanmar amid rising rivalry between India and China following clashes between the two armies in Galwan Valley, that left at least 20 Indian soldiers dead.

During Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Myanmar in January, the two countries signed a slew of pacts, including a concession and shareholder's agreement for Kyaukphyu Special Economic Zone off the Bay of Bengal. With a deepwater port, it is the terminus of the 1,700-km China-Myanmar Economic Corridor, a major link in Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative, whose other end lies in China's Yunnan province.

Other agreements covered oil and gas pipelines, and road and rail projects from southern China through Myanmar to Kyaukphyu.

China now accounts for 70 percent of foreign investments in Myanmar's energy sector.

India and Myanmar also discussed progress in the ongoing Indian-assisted infrastructure projects. They agreed to work towards operationalisation of Sittwe Port in Rakhine in the first quarter of 2021.

Competition between India and China grows over influence in the natural resources-rich Myanmar, which is facing a genocide case at the top UN court, for its treatment of Rohingya.

Some 750,000 Rohingya fled a brutal military campaign in Rakhine State to Bangladesh in 2017.

Bangladesh, burdened with sheltering one million Rohingya, has been seeking assistance of India and China, the regional powers both having close relations with Myanmar.

The issue also came up during the Joint Consultative Commission (JCC) meeting between Bangladesh and India on September 29.

Rohingya repatriation has not been possible despite two attempts in the last three years. Rohingyas say conditions in Rakhine are not safe and there is no guarantee of citizenship and freedom of movement.

During the JCC meeting, Bangladesh Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen said pockets of radicalisation may grow in Rohingya camps if repatriation does not take place at the earliest.

During the meeting with Suu Kyi, Shringla conveyed India's support for ensuring safe, sustainable and speedy return of displaced persons (Rohingya) to Rakhine from Bangladesh ""based on the understanding between Bangladesh and Myanmar"", reports India Today, quoting sources.

China has also spoken of assistance in Rohingya repatriation, but it has yet to yield any concrete result."

He said even though the original autopsy report mentioned the cause of death as low blood pressure, the submitted viscera report by the IO mentioned it as ""insecticide poison"".

As a result, he had to spend four months in jail, said Raju, who is out on bail now.

IO Md Mahmudur Rahman, also sub-inspector of Kathalia Police Station, claimed that the different viscera report was submitted ""mistakenly"". He said it belonged to another victim who supposedly died of poisoning.

""I will appeal to the court to change the charge sheet and viscera report,"" he told The Daily Star.

Meanwhile, the court (Nari O Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal-1) has already show-caused the IO over the issue, confirmed Pulak Chandra Ray, officer-in-charge of Kathalia Police Station.

""Although my wife, who was a heart patient, died due to illness on January 28 last year, her family members filed three cases against me, accusing me of her death,"" said Raju at the press conference.

""I am a victim of police harassment and torture. I demand punishment for those responsible,"" he said.

Raju (38) said he married Dulali Khatun (36) in 2012, before he went to Qatar for work. He returned in 2017.

A day after his wife died, in January 2019, Bhandaria police detained and handed him over to Kathalia police based on the complaint from his in-laws, he said.

Three cases were filed against him with Kathalia Police Station, Jhalakati Senior Judicial Magistrate court and Nari O Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal-1.

SI Mahmudur Rahman was the IO in all the cases.

Asked about the matter, OC Pulak said he joined Kathalia Police Station in January this year while the incident took place last year. He is not fully aware of the incident. Regarding the issue with the viscera report, he said the court is looking into it.

Despite repeated attempts, this correspondent could not get in touch with Raju's in-laws for comments."

He was addressing an extended meeting of Gazipur district unit of AL through videoconferencing from his official residence on parliament premises.

Quader, also road transport and bridges minister, said the government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has tougher stance not only against rape or violence on women, but also against any sort of criminal activities, irregularities and corruption.

Accused in every incident have been arrested and brought to justice, he said, adding that the government -- in a self-motivated way -- carried out drives against illegal casinoes and irregularities and corruption in different sectors, including health.

The AL general secretary said BNP is making ""evil attempts"" to divert the anti-rape movement to a different direction to oust the government.

""BNP is carrying out their conspiracies to give a violent shape to a peaceful movement. The government remains alert about their plots and efforts are underway to identify those who are spreading rumours,"" he said.

He sounded a note of warning that if anybody carries out ill-efforts to create an unstable situation, the government will handle it with an iron hand.

About the formation of committees of different organisational units of the party, he said tested and devoted workers must be evaluated while forming committees as there is no room for wrongdoers and opportunists in the party."

Led by Rahmuna Ahmed, a writer, researcher and anthropologist, the delegation issued the statement yesterday.

Other members of the delegation were Bithi Ghosh, a teacher and cultural activist; Jannatul Mawa, political activist and photographer; Mahfuza Haq, cultural and human rights activist; Shipra Bosh, development activist; and Taslima Akhter, organiser of workers and women's movement.

They visited Noakhali's Begumganj from Dhaka and exchanged views with a cross-section of society, including the Deputy Commissioner and Police Superintendent of Noakhali.

They also spoke to the rape victim.

The statement said the victim will not get justice if the ongoing movement is limited only to demanding arrest and punishment of the perpetrators. Questions must be raised and movement waged against the source of power of the perpetrators, who are patronised by the ruling force.

""It was not possible to ensure a safe life and safe movement for women keeping the source of power of Delwar gang hidden,"" the delegation said in the statement.

During their meeting with the Deputy Commissioner and SP of Noakhali and officer-in-charge of Begumganj Police Station, they called upon the authority figures to play the highest role in ensuring safety of the rape victim.

They also called upon all to wage a strong social movement against all incidents of rape and repression against women including the one in Noakhali.

While talking with the rape victim, they assured that she is not alone in the movement against rape. They also said her courage will strengthen the movement against rape and rape culture.

According to the case statement filed by the victim on October 4, the perpetrators including the main accused Badal, ""Delwar Bahini"" chief Delwar, Rahmat Ullah and Abdur Rahim, among others entered the house of the victim and beat up her husband on the night of the incident.

They took him to the adjacent room and tied him up.

Later, they tortured the victim and assaulted her while filming the incident on their phone.

At one point, locals gathered around the house hearing the victim's cry for help. The accused then threatened to kill her if she spoke about the incident, and left.

The victim, fearing for her life, fled her house and has been living elsewhere since then.

The perpetrators, however, contacted her over phone and threatened to release the recorded video of the incident on social media if she did not go back to her house and agree to their demands. As the victim did not agree to their immoral proposals, they released the video on social media on October 4.

As the video circulated widely, police located her and questioned her about the incident, following which she filed the case against her perpetrators, the statement reads.

The whole country was sparked with outrage after the recorded video of the incident was released on social media."
